AI Conversational Data Science Tutor


Welcome to the AI Conversational Data Science Robot, a futuristic, interactive Streamlit application powered by Google's Gemini API. This project combines a sleek robotic interface with a conversational AI tutor to assist users in learning data science concepts, answering queries, and providing an engaging experience with text-to-speech and 3D visuals.

The current version leverages the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, styled with a sci-fi aesthetic, and includes a bouncing robot mascot, voice responses, and a 3D scene powered by Spline. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, this tutor is here to help with a "Beep boop!" and a wealth of knowledge.
